     An if statement uses a conditional statement to determine if the code should run.
     * If statements can be coupled with an else statement or elif statement.
     *
     * Let's make an if statement that does the following:
     * if the modulus value of num by 2 is 0 then it should return 'Even'
     * else 'Odd'
    
    Instead of returning Null this method should check the condition and return whether the number is Even or Odd.
    
    :param num: An integer number to check.
    :return: 'Even' if the number is even, 'Odd' if the number is odd.
