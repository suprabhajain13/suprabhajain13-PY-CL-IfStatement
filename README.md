# PY-CL-IfStatement


## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of if statements in Python programming. It includes implementation files for a simple function that determines whether a given number is even or odd. Additionally, unit tests are provided to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the program. It prompts the user to input a number, calls the `even_or_odd` function from `lab.py`, and prints the result.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of the `even_or_odd` function. This function takes an integer input and returns a string indicating whether the number is even or odd.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the `even_or_odd` function. It verifies the behavior of the function for both even and odd numbers using the `unittest` framework.

## Project Structure
- app.py
- lab.py
- lab_test.py

## Usage
1. Run the `app.py` file to execute the program.
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. The program will determine whether the entered number is even or odd and display the result.

## Testing
1. Run the `lab_test.py` file to execute the unit tests.
2. The tests will validate the behavior of the `even_or_odd` function for various input scenarios.
3. Ensure that all tests pass to confirm the correctness of the implementation.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a simple example of using if statements in Python to perform conditional logic. By running the program and examining the code, you can gain a better understanding of how if statements work and their application in real-world scenarios.

Happy Coding!
